ok so for a general question on stoke's (its fine no need to contradict me if im right) these are the usual steps:

for the double int:
find the vector field F
Do the curl of F
parametrize the path
compute the cross prod of the partials of the parametrized fct
now plug in the parametrized fct in the curl of F
multiply (dot prod) the parametrized fct in the curl of F with the cross prod of the partials of the parametrized fct
and integrate twice, as for the bounds idk it depends on the shape

For line integral method:
find the vector field
Parametrize the path
find the derivative of the parametrized path
do F(c(t)) * c'(t) dt, cuz ds is c'(t) dt
and add all the integrals cuz there will be c1(t), c2(t),...

for Green's:

for the regular greens theorem:
for the double int method:
Find P and Q
Find Qx and Py
For the bounds it depends idk
for the line int method:
parametrize, find c1(t), c2(t), c3(t),c4(t),...
for each path do int P(c1(t))*c1'(t)dt + Q(c1(t))*c1'(t)dt + int P(c2(t))*c2'(t)dt + Q(c2(t))*c2'(t)dt + ...

for area:
literally plug in

for vector form:
double int method:
find vector field F
find curl F
dot prod of curl F and (0,0,1)
and for the bounds idk depends on the question
line int method:
 find the vector field
Parametrize the path
find the derivative of the parametrized path
do F(c(t)) * c'(t) dt, cuz ds is c'(t) dt
and add all the integrals cuz there will be c1(t), c2(t),...
Literally like stokes.

for divergence thm for greens (or flux form):
double int method:
find vector field F
find div F
double int dxdy
line int method:
find vector field F
forgot how to find n_hat tho fuck
