\begin{definition}[Differential Equation]
    A differential equation (DE) is a relation that involves an unknown function and some of its derivatives.
\end{definition}
To better understand what a differential equation is, consider the following example.\\
Imagine a ball of mass \(m\) falling, subject to gravity and air resistance (drag). Denote by \(v(t)\) the velocity of the ball at time \(t\), whereas \(t\) is the independent variable, and \(v\) the dependent variable. Let the downward direction be positive. We know the force of gravity is given by \(F_g = mg\), where \(g\) is the acceleration due to gravity. The drag force is given by \(F_d = -\lambda v\), where \(\lambda\) is the drag coefficient and is \(\lambda \geq 0\). According to Newton's second law \(\sum F = ma\), the net force acting on the ball is equal to its mass times its acceleration
\[m\frac{dv}{dt} = mg - \lambda v.\]
Let \(y(t)\) be the position, meaning \(v(t) = \frac{dy}{dt}\). Then, we can rewrite the above equation as
\[my'' + \lambda y' = mg.\]

Let's analyze another example, population growth (known as the Malthusian growth model).\\
Denote by \(N(t)\) the size of a given population at time t. In an "unconstraint" environment, it is reasonable to assume that the rate of change of the number of individuals is proportional to the number of individuals present. This assumption leads to the following differential equation:
\[\frac{dN}{dt} = rN,\]
where \(r\) is called the growth rate (if \(r > 0\)), and decay rate (if \(r < 0\)). Assume that \(N > 0\). Using the chain rule and assuming that \(N(t)\) satisfies \(N' = rN\)
\[\frac{d}{dt}ln(N(t)) = \frac{dln(N)}{dN} \cdot \frac{dN}{dt} = \frac{1}{N} \cdot N' = r,\]
integrate with respect to t
\[ln(N(t)) = rt + C,\]
where \(C\) is the constant of integration. Exponentiating both sides, we obtain
\[N(t) = e^{ln(N(t))} = e^Ce^{rt} = ke^{rt},\]
where \(\{k > 0 | k \in \mathbb{R}\}\) which could be any positive constant is the initial population size at time \(t = 0\).\\
Assume that an initial population (condition) is given:
\[N(0) = N_0 (fixed),\]
we therefore get that \(k = N_0\), and the unique solution that satisfies the initial condition is
\[N(t) = N_0e^{rt}.\]

The problem with the answer we got in the previous example is that it is not realistic in the long run, how about we consider a carrying capacity\footnote{maximum population size that the environment can sustain indefinitely}. This leads us to another example: Population growth/decay with the carrying capacity of the environment.\\
Now assume that our growth rate depends on the population size \(N(t)\) itself, therefore we get that
\[\frac{dN}{dt} = R(N)N.\]
Denote by K the number of individual that the environment can carry. K is called the carrying capacity of the environment. If \(N < K\), we want growth \((R(N) > 0)\) and if \(N > K\), we want decay \((R(N) < 0)\).\\

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
Let's pick the simplest function \(R(N)\) that satisfies \(R(0) = r, R(K) = 0\) and is linear. We get that
\[R(N) = r(1 - \frac{N}{K}).\]
Therefore, our differential equation becomes
\[\frac{dN}{dt} = r(1 - \frac{N}{K})N = \frac{r}{K}(K - N(t))N(t).\]
This is called the logistic equation.

\begin{definition}[Ordinary Differential Equation]
    An ordinary differential equation (ODE) is a differential equation whose unknown function depends on one independent variable only.
\end{definition}
Example of ODEs:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \(y''(t) + y'(t) + 2y(t) = sin(t)\)
    \item \(N'(t) = rN(t)\)
    \item \(mv'(t) = mg - \lambda v(t)\)
    \item \(y'(x) + 3y(x) = e^x\)
\end{itemize}
\begin{definition}[Partial Differential Equation]
    A partial differential equation (PDE) is a differential equation whose unknown function depends on more than one independent variable. \textbf{Will not be taught in this course.}
\end{definition}
Example of a PDE is the Heat Equation. Let \(u = u(x,t)\), \(\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}\). This PDE denotes the temperature of a body at time t and at position x.

\subsection{Classification}

\subsubsection{The Order}
\begin{definition}
    The order of an ODE is the order of the highest derivative that appears in the equation.
\end{definition}
\begin{example}
    \(N' = rN\) (first order ODE)
\end{example}
\begin{example}
    \(y''(t) + 2y'(t) = e^t\) (second order ODE)
\end{example}
Given \(n \in \mathbb{N}\), an \(n\)\textsuperscript{th} order scalar ODE is written as
\[F(t, y(t), y'(t), y''(t), \ldots, y^{(n)}(t)) = 0,\]
where \(F : \mathbb{R}^{n + 2} \to \mathbb{R}\) is a map and where \(y^{(k)}(t) = \frac{d^ky}{dt^k}(t), k = 1, \ldots, n\).\\\\

\noindent\textbf{Systems of first order ODEs}\\
\indent Consider a map \(f: D \times (a,b) \to \mathbb{R}^n\), where \(D \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n\) is an open set, and (a,b) is a "time" interval. A general first order system of ODEs is given by \(y'(t) = f(y(t), t)\), where \(y(t) = \begin{pmatrix}y_1(t)\\ \vdots \\ y_n(t)\end{pmatrix}\), \(f = \begin{pmatrix}f_1\\ \vdots \\ f_n\end{pmatrix}\), and \(y' = \begin{pmatrix}y'_1\\ \vdots \\ y'_n\end{pmatrix}\).\\
\textbf{Remark:} Assume that a scalar \(n\)\textsuperscript{th} order ODE has the form \[y^{(n)}(t) = G(t, y(t), y'(t), \ldots, y^{(n-1)}(t)).\]
Letting \(y_1 = y, y_2 = y', \ldots, y_n = y^{(n-1)}\). This leads us to \(y_1' = y' = y_2, y_2' = y'' = y_3, \ldots, y_{n-1}' = y^{(n-1)} = y_n, y_n' = y^{(n)} = G(t, y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n)\). Therefore, we can rewrite the \(n\)\textsuperscript{th} order ODE as a first order system of ODEs:
\[\begin{pmatrix}y_1'\\y_2'\\\vdots\\y_{n-1}'\\y_n'\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}y_2\\y_3\\\vdots\\y_n\\G(t, y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n)\end{pmatrix}\]

\begin{example}[Lorenz Equation]
    \[y_1' = \sigma(y_2 - y_1)\]
    \[y_2' = \rho y_1 - y_2 - y_1y_3\]
    \[y_3' = y_1y_2 - \beta y_3\]
    where \(\sigma, \rho, \beta\) are parameters. n = 3. This is a first order system of ODEs. They are nonlinear because of the products \(y_1y_3\) and \(y_1y_2\).
\end{example}

\subsubsection{Linearity}
\begin{definition}[Linearity]
    The n\textsuperscript{th} order ODE \(F(t, y, y', \ldots, y^{(n)}) = 0\) is linear if \(F\) is a linear polynomial in the variables \(y, y', y'', \ldots, y^{(n)}\), that is, it is of the form \(a_0(t)y^{(n)}(t) + a_1(t)y^{(n-1)}(t) + \ldots + a_{n-1}(t)y'(t) + a_n(t)y(t) = g(t)\), where \(a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_n, g\) are given functions of t. Otherwise, it is nonlinear.
\end{definition}
The system \(y' = f(y,t)\) is said to be linear if it can be written as \(y'(t) = A(t)y(t) + r(t)\) where, given \(t \in (a,b)\), \(A(t) \in M_n(\mathbb{R})\) (the set of \(n \times n\) real matrices) and \(r(t) \in \mathbb{R}^n\). Otherwise, it is nonlinear.

\begin{example}
Consider the second-order ODE
\[y'' + 2y' + y = e^t\]
\[\Longrightarrow y'' = -2y' - y + e^t.\]

Define new variables
\[y_1 = y, \qquad y_2 = y'.\]

Then the system becomes
\[\begin{pmatrix} y_1' \\ y_2' \end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -1 & -2 \end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix} y_1 \\ y_2 \end{pmatrix}
+\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ e^t \end{pmatrix}.\]

Let
\[A = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -1 & -2 \end{pmatrix},\qquad r(t) = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ e^t \end{pmatrix}.\]
\end{example}

\subsubsection{Autonomy}
\begin{definition}[Autonomy]
    The \(n\)\textsuperscript{th} order ODE \(F(t, y, y', \ldots, y^{(n)}) = 0\) is autonomous if \(F\) does not depend explicitly on t, that is, if it is of the form \(F(y, y', \ldots, y^{(n)}) = 0\). Otherwise, it is non-autonomous.
\end{definition}
\begin{example}
    \(y'' + 2y' + y - e^t = 0\) is non-autonomous.
\end{example}
\begin{example}
    \(N'(t) = rN(t)\) is autonomous.
\end{example}
\begin{example}
    \(y'(t) = ty(t)\) is non-autonomous.
\end{example}

\noindent Equivalently, a first-order system \(y' = f(y,t)\) is autonomous if it can be written as \[ y' = f(y). \] Otherwise, it is non-autonomous.\\

\textbf{Note:} The Lorenz system is an example of an autonomous system\footnote{Here “system” means the unknown \(y\) is vector-valued, e.g. \(y \in \mathbb{R}^m\), rather than scalar.}.

\subsubsection{Solutions of ODEs}
\begin{definition}[Solutions of ODEs]
    Let \(f: D \times (a,b) \to \mathbb{R}^n\). A solution of \(y'(t) = f(y(t), t)\) on an interval \(J \subset \mathbb{R}\) is a differentiable function \(y: J \to D \subset \mathbb{R}^n\), such that \(y'(t) = f(y(t), t), \forall t \in J\). \(t\) is the independent variable, and \(y = (y_1, \ldots, y_n)\) is the dependent variable.
\end{definition}

\noindent\textbf{Explicit Solutions}
\begin{example}
    Consider the ODE
    \[y' + y = 1.\]
    We can verify that \(y(t) = e^{-t} + 1\), and therefore \(y'(t) = -e^{-t}\), is a solution on \(\mathbb{R}\). Indeed,
    \[y' + y = -e^{-t} + (e^{-t} + 1) = 1.\]
    In this example, \(y = y(t)\) is explicitly given as a function of t (independent variable).
\end{example}

\noindent\textbf{Implicit solutions}
\begin{example}
Consider the ODE
\[y \frac{dy}{dx} = x.\]
This is a nonautonomous, nonlinear, first-order scalar ODE. Separating variables gives
\[y\,dy = x\,dx.\]
Integrating,
\[\frac{1}{2}y^2 = \frac{1}{2}x^2 + C,\]
or equivalently, the implicit solution
\[x^2 - y^2 = C, \qquad C \in \mathbb{R}.\]
To verify, differentiate implicitly:
\[\frac{d}{dx}(x^2 - y^2) = 0 \;\Longrightarrow\; 2x - 2y\frac{dy}{dx} = 0\;\Longrightarrow\; y\frac{dy}{dx} = x.\]
\end{example}
